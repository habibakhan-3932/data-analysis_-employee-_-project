Employee Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

->README – Employee Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

->Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing a large, messy employee dataset. The dataset contained missing values, inconsistent formatting, and incorrect data types. Through this project, I applied real-world data cleaning and visualization techniques using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).

->Task 1: Data Cleaning
The first task was to clean the messy employee dataset (messy_employee_data.csv).
I performed the following:
- Removed unwanted spaces and renamed inconsistent column names.
- Converted data types (e.g., salary and experience into numeric form).
- Handled missing values using appropriate statistical methods like mean and median.
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant records for better accuracy.
After cleaning, the final data was stored as cleaned_employee_data.csv.

->Task 2: Data Visualization
Once the dataset was ready, I used Matplotlib and NumPy to visualize key insights:
1. Gender Distribution – A bar chart showing the ratio of male and female employees.
2. Average Salary by Department – Compared salary trends across different departments.
3. Age Distribution – A histogram displaying the age range of employees.
4. Experience vs Salary – A scatter plot showing how experience influences salary.
5. Department Composition – A pie chart showing the percentage of employees per department.

These visualizations provided a clear view of the workforce distribution, pay structure, and experience levels within the organization.
